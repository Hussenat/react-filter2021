in Heroku Hosting Company two or more people is allowed to use the same hosting folder or file e.g react-course-projects032021 
But before another person is allow to use the folder one need to go to his or her the git dashboard then click on deploy
and copy this heroku git:remote -a react-expensify21122021 for it to check
also for safety if one is on done with the deployment one should always log in because the login session always expire
